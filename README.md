I am interested in this dataset of top YouTubers because I watch YouTube for everything, an extremely helpful tool that everyone has access to.

The dataset for this can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noreasonsu/youtube-top-1000-channels-updated-nov-2024?resource=download

This dataset was made by HypeAuditor where you can track and analyze influencers and accounts, it is tracked to date, from when I believe YouTube was made actually.

This dataset contains information such as the name of the YouTuber, # of Subscribers, # of Avg Viewers, # of Avg Likes, # of Comments, and the country they're from.
